<h2> Why Graph AI?</h2>

<p>Recent success of deep learning has boosted research on almost every aspect of computer science.
  Machine learning tasks, like object detection, machine translation, and speech recognition,
  have been given new life with end-to-end deep learning paradigms like CNN, RNN, transformer, etc.</p>
<p>Deep Learning is good at capturing hidden patterns of <strong>Euclidean</strong> data (images, text, videos).
  But what about applications where data is generated from <strong>non-Euclidean</strong> domains,
  represented as graphs with <strong>complex relationships</strong> and <strong>interdependencies</strong> between objects?</p>
<p>That’s where <a href= "https://aimagazine.com/machine-learning/what-graph-ai">Graph AI</a>
  or <a href= "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00696.pdf">Graph ML</a> come in,
  which we’ll explore in this article.</p>

<h2>What is Graph AI and Graph ML?</h2>

<p>We know that conventional AI learns from independent data samples, like images.
However, in many application scenarios, data objects are not isolated, like people in the social networks, they are inherently connected or corelated.
So Graph AI can leverage this relational information in the data to potentially learn better, by introducing a graph to model the relationships.
</p>
<p>
Next, we’ll start with graph theories and basic definitions, move on to GNN forms and principles, and finish with some applications of GNN.

<h2 id="definition">What is a Graph?</h2>
<p>The most fundamental part of GNN is a Graph. In computer science, a <strong>graph is a data structure consisting of two components:
  <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-graph-convolutional-networks-for-node-classification-a2bfdb7aba7b">nodes</a>
  (vertices) and edges</strong>.
  A graph <em><strong>G</strong></em> can be defined as <em><strong>G = (V, E)</strong></em>, where<strong> <em>V</em></strong>
  is the set of nodes, and <em><strong>E</strong></em> are the edges between them.
  If there are directional dependencies between nodes then edges are directed. If not, edges are undirected.</p>

<p>A graph can represent things like social media networks, or molecules. Think of nodes as users, and edges as connections.</p>
<p>A graph is often represented by <em><strong>A</strong></em>, an adjacency matrix.
  If a graph has <strong><em>n</em></strong> nodes, <strong><em>A</em></strong> has a dimension of <em><strong>(n × n)</strong></em>.
  Sometimes the nodes have a set of features (for example, a user profile).
  If the node has <em><strong>f</strong></em> numbers of features,
  then the node feature matrix <em><strong>X</strong></em> has a dimension of <em><strong>(n × f)</strong></em>.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is it hard to analyze a graph?</strong></h3>

<p>Graph data is so complex that it’s created a lot of challenges for existing machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>The reason is that conventional Machine Learning and Deep Learning tools are specialized in simple data types.
  Like images with the same structure and size, which we can think of as fixed-size grid graphs.
  Text and speech are sequences, so we can think of them as line graphs.</p>
<p>But there are more complex graphs, without a fixed form, with a variable size of unordered nodes,
  where nodes can have different amounts of neighbors.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t help that existing machine learning algorithms have a core assumption that instances are independent of each other.
  This is false for graph data, because each node is related to others by links of various types.</p>

<h2 id="GNN">Graph Neural Network</h2>
<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning methods designed to perform inference on data described by graphs.
GNNs are neural networks that can be directly applied to graphs,
and provide an easy way to do node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks.
GNNs can do what Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) failed to do.</p>

<h3><strong>Why do Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) fail on graphs?</strong></h3>
<p>See <a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/graph-neural-network-and-some-of-gnn-applications#GNN">here</a> for explaination.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll discuss Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).</p>

<h2 id="GCN">Graph Convolutional Networks</h2>
<h3> </h3>

<p>
  GCNs were first introduced in “Spectral Networks and Deep Locally Connected Networks on Graphs” (Bruna et al, 2014),
  as a method for applying neural networks to graph-structured data.
  The simplest GCN has only three different operators:
</p>

<div class="custom-point-list">
<ul><li>Graph convolution</li><li>Linear layer</li><li>Nonlinear activation</li></ul>
</div>

<p>
The operations are usually done in this order.
Together, they make up one network layer. We can combine one or more layers to form a complete GCN.
</p>

<h2 id="Applications">Applications of GNNs</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/graph-neural-network-and-some-of-gnn-applications">Here</a> is a list of GNN applications.
The problems that GNNs resolve can be classified into these categories:
</p>

<div class="custom-point-list">
<ol><li><strong>Node Classification:</strong> the task here is to determine the labeling of samples (represented as nodes) by looking at the labels of their neighbors. Usually, problems of this type are trained in a semi-supervised way, with only a part of the graph being labeled.</li><li><strong>Graph Classification:</strong> the task here is to classify the whole graph into different categories. It’s like image classification, but the target changes into the graph domain. The applications of graph classification are numerous and range from determining whether a protein is an enzyme or not in bioinformatics, to categorizing documents in NLP, or social network analysis.</li><li><strong>Graph visualization:</strong> is an area of mathematics and computer science, at the intersection of geometric graph theory and information visualization. It is concerned with the visual representation of graphs that reveals structures and anomalies that may be present in the data and helps the user to understand the graphs.</li><li><strong>Link prediction:</strong> here, the algorithm has to understand the relationship between entities in graphs, and it also tries to predict whether there’s a connection between two entities. It’s essential in social networks to infer social interactions or to suggest possible friends to the users. It has also been used in recommender system problems and in predicting criminal associations.</li><li><strong>Graph clustering:</strong> refers to the <em>clustering</em> of data in the form of graphs. There are two distinct forms of clustering performed on graph data. Vertex clustering seeks to cluster the nodes of the graph into groups of densely connected regions based on either edge weights or edge distances. The second form of graph clustering treats the graphs as the objects to be clustered and clusters these objects based on similarity.</li></ol>

<p>
Let’s go through some applications across domains where GNN can resolve various challenges.
</p>

<h3><strong>GNNs in computer vision</strong></h3>
<p>Using regular CNNs, machines can distinguish and identify objects in images and videos.
  Although there is still much development needed for machines to have the visual intuition of a human.
  Yet, GNN architectures can be applied to image classification problems.</p>

<p>One of these problems is scene graph generation,
  in which the model aims to parse an image into a semantic graph that consists of objects and their semantic relationships.
  Given an image, scene graph generation models detect and recognize objects and predict semantic relationships between pairs of objects.</p>

<p>However, the number of applications of GNNs in computer vision is still growing.
  It includes human-object interaction, few-shot image classification, and more.</p>

<p> <a href=""> </a> </p>

<h3><strong>GNNs in Natural Language Processing</strong></h3>
<p>In NLP, we know that the text is a type of sequential data which can be described by an RNN or an LSTM.
  However, graphs are heavily used in various NLP tasks, due to their naturalness and ease of representation.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying GNNs for a large number of NLP problems like text classification,
  exploiting semantics in machine translation, user geolocation, relation extraction, or question answering.</p>

<p>We know that every node is an entity and edges describe relations between them.
  In NLP research, the problem of question answering is not recent.
  But it was limited by the existing database. Although, with techniques like GraphSage (Hamilton et al.),
  the methods can be generalized to previously unseen nodes.</p>

<h3><strong>GNNs in traffic</strong></h3>
<p>Forecasting traffic speed, volume or the density of roads in traffic networks is fundamentally important in a smart transportation system.
  We can address the traffic prediction problem by using STGNNs.</p>

<p>Considering the traffic network as a spatial-temporal graph where the nodes are sensors installed on roads,
  the edges are measured by the distance between pairs of nodes,
  and each node has the average traffic speed within a window as dynamic input features.</p>

<h3><strong>GNNs in chemistry</strong></h3>

<p>Chemists can use GNNs to research the graph structure of molecules or compounds.
  In these graphs, nodes are atoms, and edges &#8211; chemical bonds.</p>

<h3><strong>GNNs in other domains</strong></h3>

<p>The application of GNNs is not limited to the above domains and tasks.
  There have been attempts to apply GNNs to a variety of problems such as program verification,
  program reasoning, social influence prediction, recommender systems, electrical health records modeling,
  brain networks, and adversarial attack prevention.</p>

<h2>A summary overview of GNNs Applications</h2>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Over the past few years, graph neural networks have become
  powerful and practical tools for any problem that can be modeled by graphs.</p>

<p>In this article, we did a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks and introduced a wide range of GNN applications.</p>
