<h2> Why Graph AI?</h2>

<p>Recent success of deep learning has boosted research on almost every aspect of computer science.
  Machine learning tasks, like object detection, machine translation, and speech recognition,
  have been given new life with end-to-end deep learning paradigms like CNN, RNN, transformer, etc.</p>
<p>Deep Learning is good at capturing hidden patterns of <strong>Euclidean</strong> data (images, text, videos).
  But what about applications where data is generated from <strong>non-Euclidean</strong> domains,
  represented as graphs with <strong>complex relationships</strong> and <strong>interdependencies</strong> between objects?</p>
<p>That’s where <a href= "https://aimagazine.com/machine-learning/what-graph-ai">Graph AI</a>
  or <a href= "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00696.pdf">Graph ML</a> come in,
  which we’ll explore in this article.</p>

<h2>What is Graph AI and Graph ML?</h2>

<p>We know that conventional AI learns from independent data samples, like images.
However, in many application scenarios, data objects are not isolated, like people in the social networks, they are inherently connected or corelated.
So Graph AI can leverage this relational information in the data to potentially learn better, by introducing a graph to model the relationships.
</p>
<p>
Next, we’ll start with graph theories and basic definitions, move on to GNN forms and principles, and finish with some applications of GNN.

<h2 id="definition">What is a Graph?</h2>
<p>The most fundamental part of GNN is a Graph.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Why is it hard to analyze a graph?</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<h2 id="GNN">Graph Neural Network</h2>
<p></p>

<h3><strong>Why do Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) fail on graphs?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Next, I’ll discuss Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).</p>

<h2 id="Applications">Applications of GNNs</h2>

<h3><strong>GNNs in computer vision</strong></h3>
<p>Using regular CNNs, machines can distinguish and identify objects in images and videos.
  Although there is still much development needed for machines to have the visual intuition of a human.
  Yet, GNN architectures can be applied to image classification problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of these problems is scene graph generation,
  in which the model aims to parse an image into a semantic graph that consists of objects and their semantic relationships.
  Given an image, scene graph generation models detect and recognize objects and predict semantic relationships between pairs of objects.</p>

<p>However, the number of applications of GNNs in computer vision is still growing.
  It includes human-object interaction, few-shot image classification, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>GNNs in Natural Language Processing</strong></h3>
<p>In NLP, we know that the text is a type of sequential data which can be described by an RNN or an LSTM.
  However, graphs are heavily used in various NLP tasks, due to their naturalness and ease of representation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying GNNs for a large number of NLP problems like text classification,
  exploiting semantics in machine translation, user geolocation, relation extraction, or question answering.</p>

<p>We know that every node is an entity and edges describe relations between them.
  In NLP research, the problem of question answering is not recent.
  But it was limited by the existing database. Although, with techniques like GraphSage (Hamilton et al.),
  the methods can be generalized to previously unseen nodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>GNNs in traffic</strong></h3>
<p>Forecasting traffic speed, volume or the density of roads in traffic networks is fundamentally important in a smart transportation system.
  We can address the traffic prediction problem by using STGNNs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Considering the traffic network as a spatial-temporal graph where the nodes are sensors installed on roads,
  the edges are measured by the distance between pairs of nodes,
  and each node has the average traffic speed within a window as dynamic input features.</p>

<h3><strong>GNNs in chemistry</strong></h3>

<p>Chemists can use GNNs to research the graph structure of molecules or compounds.
  In these graphs, nodes are atoms, and edges &#8211; chemical bonds.</p>

<h3><strong>GNNs in other domains</strong></h3>

<p>The application of GNNs is not limited to the above domains and tasks.
  There have been attempts to apply GNNs to a variety of problems such as program verification,
  program reasoning, social influence prediction, recommender systems, electrical health records modeling,
  brain networks, and adversarial attack prevention.</p>

<h2>A summary overview of GNNs Applications</h2>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Over the past few years, graph neural networks have become
  powerful and practical tools for any problem that can be modeled by graphs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this article, we did a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks and introduced a wide range of GNN applications.</p>
