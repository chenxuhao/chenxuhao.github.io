	<h1>Xuhao Chen</h1>
	<p>I am an assistant research scientist at <em>College of Computer</em>, 
	National University of Defense Technology (NUDT). I work on computer architecture and computer systems, 
	with an emphasis on heterogeneous processors and massively parallel accelerators. 
	My recent work focuses on algorithmic, compiler, runtime, and architectural support for irregular parallelism, 
	especially the memory irregularity in modern parallel processors. 
	I received B.S. and Ph.D. degree from NUDT in 2009 and 2014 respectively. 
	I spent two years (from 2012 to 2014) as a visiting Ph.D. student 
	at the IMPACT Research group in University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
