<h2> Scalable Vector Database [<a href="https://elx.mit.edu/experience/c67c0e7e-34ef-4de9-a95f-05e92e5c88d3">Elx Link</a>]</h2>

  <p>
    Recent advances in deep learning models map almost all types of data (e.g., images, videos, documents) into high-dimension vectors.
    Queries on high-dimensional vectors enable complex semantic-analysis that was previously difficult if not impossible,
    thus they become the cornerstone for many important online services like search, eCommerce, and recommendation systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/vector-database.png" alt="Vector Database" style="width:570px;height:300px;">
  </p>

  <p>
    In this project we aim to build a massive-scale <strong>Vector Database</strong> on the multi-CPU and multi-GPU platform.
    In a Vector Database, the major operation is to search the k closest vectors to a given query vector,
    known as k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) search. Due to massive data scale, Approximate Nearest-Neighbor (ANN) search is used in practice instead.
    One of the most promising ANN approaches is the graph-based approach, which first constructs a proximity graph on the dataset,
    connecting pairs of vectors that are close to each other, then performs a graph traversal on the proximity
    graph for each query to find the closest vectors to a query vector. In this project we will build a vector
    database using graph-based ANN search algorithm that supports billion-scale datasets.

  <h2> Zero-Knowledge Proof [<a href="https://elx.mit.edu/experience/c67c0e7e-34ef-4de9-a95f-05e92e5c88d3">Elx Link</a>]</h2>

    <p>
      Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method of proving the validity of a statement without revealing anything other than the validity of the statement itself.
      This “zero-knowledge” property is attractive for many privacy-preserving applications, such as blockchain and cryptocurrency systems.
      Despite its great potential, ZKP is notoriously compute intensive, which hampers its real-world adoption.
      Recent advances in cryptography, known as zk-SNARK, have brought ZKP closer to practical use.
      Although zk-SNARK enables fast verification of the proof, proof generation in ZKP is still quite expensive and slow.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/zkp.png" alt="Zero-Knowledge Proof" style="width:600px;height:300px;">
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, we will explore ZKP acceleration by using algorithm innovations, software performance engineering, and parallel hardware like GPU, FPGA or even ASIC.
      We aim to investigate and implement efficient algorithms for accelerating elliptic curve computation.
      We will also explore acceleration opportunities for the major operations, e.g., finite field arithmetic, Multi-scalar Multiplication (MSM) and Number-theoretic transformations (NTT).

    <h2> Deep Recommendation System [<a href="https://elx.mit.edu/experience/c67c0e7e-34ef-4de9-a95f-05e92e5c88d3">Elx Link</a>]</h2>

      <p>
        Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) are widely used across industry to provide personalized recommendations to users and consumers.
        Specifically, they are the backbone behind user engagement for industries such as ecommerce, entertainment, and social networks.
        DLRMs have two stages: (1) training, in which the model learns to minimize the difference between predicted and actual user interactions,
        and (2) inference, in which the model provides recommendations based on new data.
        Traditionally, GPUs have been the hardware component of choice for DLRM training because of the high computational demand.
        In contrast, CPUs have been widely used for DLRM inference due to tight latency requirements that restrict the batch size.
        An existing bottleneck in inference is the high computational and memory bandwidth, which contribute greatly to loads on data centers and computing clusters.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="images/DRS.png" alt="Deep Recommendation System" style="width:370px;height:300px;">
      </p>

      <p>
        In this project, we will focus on exploring GPU optimizations to the embedding stage of the DLRM inference pipeline, which has traditionally only utilized CPUs.
        Initially, we would like to explore CPU-GPU coupled schemes, for instance using GPUs as extra cache space (e.g. to store more embeddings or to memoize sparse feature computations),
        and multi-GPU cluster computation in order to further accelerate inference for more complex models.
        The goal is to coalesce existing inference frameworks, profile them, and implement novel ones to exhibit substantial speedup for DLRM inference on GPUs.

    The advent of cryptocurrency introduced by Bitcoin ignited an explosion of technological
    and entrepreneurial interest in payment processing.
    Dampening this excitement was Bitcoin’s bad reputation.

<h2> Scalable Graph Transformer  [<a href="https://elx.mit.edu/experience/5168d52b-590a-4c2a-abf6-9542e79438c7">Elx Link</a>] </h2>

  Transformer [1], the engine behind ChatGPT,
  has yielded competitive results in many domains such as natural language processing (NLP) [2]
  and computer vision (CV) [3] due to its unique attention mechanism
  where each element in the input data pays attention to every other element.

  Recently Graph Transformer [4,5,6] has been proposed
  by introducing the attention mechanism into graph machine learning.
  As opposed to graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs)
  where nodes use neighborhood aggregation (a.k.a. message passing) mechanisms
  to perform inference on graph data, graph transformers use the self-attention mechanism
  that can capture long-range interactions between nodes.
  However, current graph transformers do not scale to large graphs
  because of the expensive computation and memory consumption.
  Thus, this project aims to design a graph transformer with hierarchical multi-head attention (MHA)
  to improve node classification for graphs on the order of 100k-100M nodes.
