Programming Framework for Graph Pattern Mining <b>2019-2020</b> <br />
<i>With Keshav Pingali</i> <br />
Design and implemented Pangolin, an efficient and flexible graph pattern mining (GPM)
framework targeting shared-memory CPUs and GPUs. It is the first GPM system that supports
GPU mining. Pangolin provides a novel programming interface which allows users
to express application-specific optimizations. It also employs novel architecture oriented
optimizations, particularly for the GPU architecture. These innovations makes Pangolin
orders-of-magnitude faster than previous GPM systems.

Parallel Graph Algorithms on GPU <b>2015-2018</b> <br />
<i>With Zhiying Wang</i> <br />
Design and implemented various parallel graph algorithms, frameworks and benchmarks
on the GPU, for diverse graph problems ranging from graph coloring and and
strongly connected components to sparse neural networks. I proposed techniques to overcome
the challenges of insufficient parallelism, indirect memory access pattern and load imbalance,
which leads to substantial speedups over previous parallel CPU and GPU solutions.

Cache Architecture for Irregular Algorithms on GPU <b>2011-2014</b> <br />
<i>With Wen-Mei Hwu and Zhiying Wang</i> <br />
Designed and implemented efficient cache architectures [4,5,7,9] for irregular applications on
GPU. Irregular algorithms, e.g., graph algorithms, have indirect memory accesses that cause
memory divergence on GPU. The massive amount of diverged memory requests causes severe
cache contention and resource congestion. I proposed an adaptive cache management scheme
[4] specifically for the GPU architecture, which effectively combines the techniques of warp
throttling and cache bypassing, and achieves significant performance improvement.
